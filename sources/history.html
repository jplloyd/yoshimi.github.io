<h1 style="padding-bottom:0.5em;">The History of Yoshimi</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">by <span class="person">Will Godfrey</span></p>

<div class="history">

  <p>
    <span style="font-size:2em">O</span>nce upon a time, there was just
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer" target="_blank">Moog.</a>
    Then there were many.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="yoshimi">Yoshimi</span> is not
    <a href="http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/">
      <span class="zyn">ZynAddSubFX</span>
    </a>,
    but we have not forgotten from whence we hath come, and we salute thee!
  </p>

  <p>
    ZynAddSubFX was founded by <a href="http://www.paulnasca.com/">
      <span class="person">Paul Nasca</span></a> and continued by many
    others. Several years later, Yoshimi was founded by our dear friend,
    the late <span class="person">Alan Calvert (Cal)</span>, at a time when
    ZynAddSubFX showed amazing promise, but did not satisfy his needs and ours.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="person">Jeremy Jongepier</span> was instrumental in
    obtaining access to the SourceForge repository after we lost Cal,
    and maintained it until early 2014, accepting small improvements
    from a number of people. Then, with a young family and other interests,
    he felt he could no longer do so. At that time, I had become well known
    as a Yoshimi instrument designer and a sort-of general bug finder,
    and, with considerable prompting from others, agreed to take over as
    a caretaker. I had limited C coding experience, no C++ knowledge,
    and never been involved in version control.
  </p>

  <p>
    The early work was mainly minor corrections and improvements.
    Many people gave support, in particular <span class="person">Rob Couto</span>,
    who has been a mentor and contributor throughout this time.
    <span class="person">Harry Nakos</span> helped me with the first GUI change
    - enabling a single row mixer panel. Later, <span class="person">Andrew
      Deryabin</span> coded the LV2 and multi-instance extensions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, <span class="person">Harry</span> supplied the preliminary
    example code that was to become the basis of the much improved instrument
    bank structure. <span class="person">Andrew</span> then ran with this and
    coded the full structure, which over time has been developed further.
    Andrew also continued to provide help from time to time.
  </p>

  <p>
    By early 2015, I had gained enough experience to implement vector control,
    and later most of the NRPN code. The end of that year saw the first
    development of CLI (command line) access, aimed at making Yoshimi
    accessible to blind and disabled musicians. Since that time,
    <span class="person">Jeanette Claassen</span> has frequently given her
    invaluable advice as a blind user, as well as a segment of code to
    implement proper readline features.
  </p>

  <p>
    The channel switching feature (Solo) was implemented in the middle of 2016,
    and crossfade control arrived later in the year. A major feature, MIDI‑learn,
    was added at the end of that year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout 2017, <span class="person">Jesper Lloyd</span> provided many of the
    enhanced tooltips, along with a number of other GUI improvements and bug fixes.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the beginning of 2018, <span class="person">Kristian Amlie</span> devised
    interpolation for Yoshimi’s effects to enable smooth transition when changing
    controls in real time.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of that year, <span class="person">Hermann Voßeler</span> did
    considerable work improving and tidying up the random number generator, and
    correcting some mistakes I had made, so it is now thread-safe and
    future-proof. He continues to provide assistance.
  </p>

  <p>
    In early 2019, it became possible to <em>compile</em> a <em>headless version</em>
    of Yoshimi, and in the middle of the year, <span class="person">Kristian</span>
    implemented a major improvement to the AddSynth modulators - officially released
    with Yoshimi version 1.6.0. The copy/paste storage is also greatly improved,
    and follows a pattern similar to that of banks.
  </p>

  <p>And the story continues...</p>
