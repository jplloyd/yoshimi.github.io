  <span class="person">Alan Ernest Calvert</span> (1950 - 2011) is the founder
  of the Yoshimi project. He lived in Australia and married his childhood
  sweetheart, but sadly she died when their only child was still a toddler.
  He brought her up single-handedly, never remarried and, according to his
  daughter, never even looked at another woman.
</p>
<p>
  When he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, nobody thought he'd survive long
  enough to see his first grandson born. To everyone's astonishment, he actually
  fought it off for five years, so not only saw, but got to know both of the boys.
</p>
<p>
  Through all this, he never lost his sense of humour. This is evident in some
  of his Yoshimi list entries. For a long time on his website, there was a picture
  of his daughter and the boys, simply titled: "Three reasons to be cheerful".
  Survival rate for this cancer is very low - life expectancy is usually less
  than 6 months. However, it wasn't this that killed him, but in his weakened
  state he developed another type of cancer.
</p>
<p>
  Those who knew Cal miss him greatly. One of his legacies is our wonderful
  software synthesizer, which he called <span class="yoshimi">Yoshimi</span>.

  Two interests that go back as far as <span class="person">Will Godfrey</span>
  can remember are music and electronics. Work took him in the direction of
  electronics, but the two first came together briefly in the 1970s when
  he built effects pedals for guitarist friends.
</p>
<p>
  It wasn't until the early 1990s that he had sufficient spare funds to buy the
  (still very expensive) modern synthesisers, by which time he was quite
  involved with computers, and some limited coding. By the early 2000s he was
  finding hardware synthesisers limiting, and a Linux friend suggested that he
  should try the new soft-synth called <span class="zyn">ZynAddSubFX</span>.
  Will got immediately hooked.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="zyn">ZynAddSubFX</span> had some serious issues, which remained
  for some time. However, Cal (Alan Calvert) developed the fork
  <span class="yoshimi">Yoshimi</span>. Will moved over to it, and has stayed
  with it ever since - to the point that he is now the developer&#8209;in&#8209;chief.

  <span class="person">Jesper Lloyd</span> is a self-professed loon in
  Swedish Lapland who for some reason holds an MSc in computer science
  from Chalmers University of Technology.
</p>
<p>
  His contributions center around the GUI, where he has worked on dynamic
  tooltips, and added graphical editing for format filters. He also re-designed
  the splash screen, and has created promotional artwork for the project.

  <span class="person">Jeanette Claassen</span> is a synthesist with an eclectic
  background, mainly focussed on classical and electronic pop music.
  She acquired her first hardware synthesizer in the late 1990s, and with it a
  fascination for sound design. Being introduced to Linux in the early 2000s,
  she quickly discovered the command line based audio ecosystem, which back
  then was the safest accessibility guarantee for visually impaired users.
</p>
<p>
  She set her sights on ZynAddSubFX early on. It was Will Godfrey's dedication
  to Yoshimi's command line interface which finally gave her full access to the
  synth and effects engines, and thus made Yoshimi an integral part of her
  composition and sound design setup.

  <span class="person">Lorenzo Sutton</span> is one of
  'Yoshimi's little helpers': As an avid and enthusiastic user, he supports
  the team with testing, mailing list activity, demos, brain-storming, etc.
  Some of his music makes heavy use of Yoshimi as the main instrument.

  He is a trained musician and musicologist, and currently works in the field
  of research and innovation management for an IT company in Rome, Italy.
  He is a strong advocate and user of FLOSS, Linux, and open standards.
